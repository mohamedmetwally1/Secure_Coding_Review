# Secure-Coding-Review

## Overview
This project is focused on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in code through static code analysis and manual review. The goal is to find common security flaws, understand their risks, and apply secure coding practices to eliminate them. The repository includes example code with vulnerabilities, automated analysis results, and documentation on vulnerabilities and solutions.

## Objectives
- **Identify Security Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like **Bandit** to scan the code for potential security issues, such as SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, and unsafe functions.
- **Document Vulnerabilities**: Provide clear documentation for each identified vulnerability, including its severity, impact, and recommended solution.
- **Apply Secure Coding Practices**: Implement fixes in the code based on best security practices.
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a guide for learning secure coding principles and techniques.

```

## Tools Used
- **Bandit**: A static code analysis tool for identifying Python-specific security vulnerabilities.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Bandit**: Install Bandit for static code analysis.
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   ```

### Running the Analysis
 ```bash
   bandit example.py
   ```

## Fixing the Vulnerabilities
Review the report.md in the docs/ folder for detailed explanations of the vulnerabilities found and step-by-step instructions for fixing them.
Apply the recommended fixes to the code to mitigate security risks.
Example of Fixing SQL Injection:
If Bandit flags a SQL injection vulnerability, modify the code to use parameterized queries:

python
# Before:
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"

# After:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
