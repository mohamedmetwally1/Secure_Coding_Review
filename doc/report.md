# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the security vulnerabilities detected in the code of the project by **Bandit**, a static analysis tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. It provides a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities, their severity levels, and recommendations for improving the code's security.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. **Hardcoded Password** (`B601`)

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Confidence**: High
- **File**: `src/example.py`
- **Line**: 4
- **Description**: A hardcoded password has been found in the code. Hardcoding passwords within the code can expose them to anyone who has access to the source code, which is a significant security risk. Attackers who gain access to the code may use the password to breach systems.
  
- **Recommended Fix**:
  - **Avoid hardcoding passwords** in the source code.
  - Use environment variables or a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store sensitive information like passwords.
  
  Example fix using environment variables:
  ```python
  import os

  password = os.getenv("MY_SECRET_PASSWORD")
  if password is None:
      raise ValueError("Password not set in environment variables.")
  ```

### 2. **Use of `exec()`** (`B602`)

- **Severity**: High
- **Confidence**: Medium
- **File**: `src/example.py`
- **Line**: 9
- **Description**: The `exec()` function allows execution of arbitrary Python code. This can be a severe security risk because it opens the possibility for arbitrary code execution if user input is involved. An attacker could inject malicious code through user input, leading to unauthorized actions like file modifications or data theft.
  
- **Recommended Fix**:
  - **Avoid using `exec()`** wherever possible.
  - If dynamic execution of code is necessary, consider using safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval()` or handling the input more securely.
  
  Example fix by removing `exec()`:
  ```python
  # Replace dynamic code execution with a safer alternative
  user_input = "print('This is a test')"  # Example input
  print(user_input)
  ```
